<p>If you are about to lightmap your first scene in Unity, this <a href="../Manual/Lightmapping.html">Quickstart Guide</a> might help you out.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>Lightmapping is fully integrated in Unity, so that you can build entire levels from within the Editor, lightmap them and have your materials automatically pick up the lightmaps without you having to worry about it. Lightmapping in Unity means that all your lights' properties will be mapped directly to the Beast lightmapper and baked into textures for great performance. Unity Pro extends this functionality by Global Illumination, allowing for baking realistic and beautiful lighting, that would otherwise be impossible in realtime. Additionally Unity Pro brings you sky lights and emissive materials for even more interesting scene lighting.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>In this page you will find a more in-depth description of all the attributes that you can find in the Lightmapping window. To open the Lightmapping window select <b><span class='doc-menu'>Window</span> &ndash; <span class='doc-menu'>Lightmapping</span></b>.

<div class='vspace'></div><h2>Details</h2>
<p class='vspace'><a name='DualLightmaps' id='DualLightmaps'></a>
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><h3>Dual Lightmaps</h3>
<p>Dual lightmaps is Unity's approach to make lightmapping work with <b>specular</b>, <b>normal mapping</b> and proper blending of baked and realtime shadows. It's also a way to make your lightmaps look good even if the lightmap resolution is low.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>Dual lightmaps by default can only be used in the <a href="../Manual/RenderingPaths.html">Deferred Lighting</a> rendering path. In Forward rendering path, it's possible to enable Dual Lightmaps by writing custom shaders (use <code><a href="../Components/SL-SurfaceShaders.html">dualforward</a></code> surface shader directive).
</p>
<p class='vspace'>Dual lightmaps use two sets of lightmaps: 
</p><ul><li><b>Far</b>: Contains full illumination
</li><li><b>Near</b>: Contains indirect illumination from lights marked as <b>Auto</b>, full illumination from lights marked as <b>Bake Only</b>, emissive materials and sky lights. 
</li></ul><p class='vspace'><b>Realtime Only</b> lights are never baked. The <b>Near</b> lightmap set is used within the distance from the camera smaller than the Shadow Distance quality setting.<br />Within this distance <b>Auto</b> lights are rendered as realtime lights with specular bump and realtime shadows (this makes their shadows blend correctly with shadows from Realtime Only lights) and their indirect light is taken from the lightmap. Outside Shadow Distance <b>Auto</b> lights no longer render in realtime and full illumination is taken from the <b>Far</b> lightmap (<b>Realtime Only</b> lights are still there, but with disabled shadows).
</p>
<p class='vspace'>The scene below contains one directional light with lightmapping mode set to the default Auto, a number of static lightmapped objects (buildings, obstacles, immovable details) and some dynamic moving or movable objects (dummies with guns, barrels). The scene is baked and rendered in dual lightmaps mode: behind the shadow distance buildings are fully lit only by lightmaps, while the two dummies are dynamically lit but don't cast shadows anymore; in front of the shadow distance both the dummy and static lightmapped buildings and ground are lit in realtime and cast realtime shadows, but the soft indirect light comes from the near lightmap.
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><div><img class='figure' src='../Images/manual/LightmappingInDepth-1.jpg' /></div>
<div class='vspace'></div><div><img class='figure' src='../Images/manual/LightmappingInDepth-2.jpg' /></div>
<div class='vspace'></div><h3>Single Lightmaps</h3>
<p>Single Lightmaps is a much simpler technique, but it can be used in any <a href="../Manual/RenderingPaths.html">rendering path</a>. All static illumination (i.e. from baked only and auto lights, sky lights and emissive materials) gets baked into one set of lightmaps. These lightmaps are used on all lightmapped objects regardless of shadow distance.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>To match the strength of dynamic shadows to baked shadows, you need to manually adjust the <span class='doc-prop'>Shadow Strength</span> property of your light:
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><div><img class='figure' src='../Images/manual/LightmappingInDepth-3.jpg' /> <img class='figure' src='../Images/manual/LightmappingInDepth-4.jpg' /><br /><em>Adjusting Shadow Strength of a light from the original value of 1.0 to 0.7.</em></div>
<div class='vspace'></div><h3>Lightmapped Materials</h3>
<p>Unity doesn't require you to select special materials to use lightmaps. Any shader from the built-in shaders (and any Surface Shader you write, for that matter) already supports lightmaps out of box, without you having to worry about it - it just works.
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><h3>Lightmap Resolution</h3>
<p>With the <em>Resolution</em> bake setting you control how many texels per unit are needed for your scene to look good. If there's a 1x1 unit plane in your scene and the resolution is set to 10 texels per unit, your plane will take up 10x10 texels in the lightmap. Resolution bake setting is a global setting. If you want to modify it for a special object (make it very small or very big in the lightmap) you can use <span class='doc-prop'>Scale in Lightmap</span> property of Mesh Renderers. Setting Scale in Lightmap to 0 will result in the object not being lightmapped at all (it will still influence lightmaps on other objects). Use the <em>Lightmap Resolution</em> scene view render mode to preview how you spend your lightmap texels.
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><div><img class='figure' src='../Images/manual/LightmappingInDepth-5.jpg' /><br /><em>Lightmap Resolution scene view mode visualising how the lightmap texels are spent (each square is one texel).</em></div>
<div class='vspace'></div><h3>UVs</h3>
<p>A mesh that you're about to lightmap needs to have UVs suitable for lightmapping. The easiest way to ensure that is to enable the Generate Lightmap UVs option in Mesh Import Settings for a given mesh.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>For more information see the <a href="../Manual/LightmappingUV.html">Lightmap UVs</a> page.
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><h3>Material Properties</h3>
<p>The following material properties are mapped to Beast's internal scene representation:
</p><ul><li>Color
</li><li>Main Texture
</li><li>Specular Color
</li><li>Shininess
</li><li>Transparency
<ul><li>Alpha-based: when using a transparent shader, main texture's alpha channel will control the transparency
</li><li>Color-based: Beast's RGB transparency can be enabled by adding a texture property called <span class='doc-keyword'>_TransparencyLM</span> to the shader. Bear in mind that this transparency is defined in the opposite way compared to the alpha-based transparency: here a pixel with value (1, 0, 0) will be fully transparent to red light component and fully opaque to green and blue component, which will result in a red shadow; for the same reason white texture will be fully transparent, while black texture - fully opaque.
</li></ul></li><li>Emission
<ul><li>Self Illuminated materials will emit light tinted by the Color and Main Texture and masked by the Illum texture. The intensity of emitted light is proportional to the Emission property (0 disables emission).
</li><li>Generally large and dim light sources can be modeled as objects with emissive materials. For small and intense lights normal light types should be used, since emissive materials might introduce noise in the rendering.
</li></ul></li></ul><p class='vspace'><em>Note: When mapping materials to Beast, Unity detects the 'kind' of the shader by the shader's properties and path/name keywords such as:  'Specular', 'Transparent', 'Self-Illumin', etc.</em>
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><h3>Skinned Mesh Renderers</h3>
<p>Having skinned meshes that are static makes your content more flexible, since the shape of those meshes can be changed in Unity after import and can be tweaked per level. Skinned Mesh Renderers can be lightmapped in exactly the same way as Mesh Renderers and are sent to the lightmapper in their current pose.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>Lightmapping can also be used if the vertices of a mesh are moved at runtime a bit -- the lighting won't be completely accurate, but in a lot of cases it will match well enough.
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><h2>Advanced</h2>
<h3>Automatic Atlasing</h3>
<p>Atlasing (UV-packing) is performed automatically every time you perform a bake and normally you don't have to worry about it - it just works.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>Object's world-space surface area is multiplied by the per-object Scale In Lightmap value and by the global Resolution and the result determines the size of the object's UV set (more precisely: the size of the [0,1]x[0,1] UV square) in the lightmap. Next, all objects are packed into as few lightmaps as possible, while making sure each of them occupies the amount of space calculated in the previous step. If a UV set for a given object occupies only part of the [0,1]x[0,1] square, in many cases atlasing will move neighboring UV sets closer, to make use of the empty space.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>As a result of atlasing, every object to be lightmapped has it's place in one of the lightmaps and that space doesn't overlap with any other object's space. The atlasing information is stored as three values: Lightmap Index, Tiling (scale) and Offset in Mesh Renderers and as one value: Lightmap Index in Terrains and can be viewed and modified via the Object pane of the lightmapping window.
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><div><img class='figure' src='../Images/manual/LightmappingInDepth-6.jpg' /><br /><em>Right-clicking a lightmap lets you select all game objects that use the chosen lightmap. Lightmaps of the active object from the current selection are highlighted in yellow.</em></div>
<p class='vspace'>Atlasing can only modify per-object data which is Lightmap Index, Tiling and Offset and can not modify the UV set of an object, as the UV set is stored as part of the shared mesh. Lightmap UVs for a mesh can only be created at import time using Unity's built-in auto-unwrapper or in an external 3D package before importing to Unity.
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><h3>Lock Atlas</h3>
<p>When Lock Atlas is enabled, automatic atlasing won't be run and Lightmap Index, Tiling and Offset on the objects won't be modified. Beast will rely on whatever is the current atlasing, so it's the user's responsibility to maintain correct atlasing (e.g. no overlapping objects in the lightmaps, no objects referencing a lightmap slot past the lightmap array end, etc.).
</p>
<p class='vspace'>Lock Atlas opens up the possibility for alternative workflows when sending your object's for lightmapping. You can then perform atlasing manually or via scripting to fit you specific needs; you can also lock the automatically generated atlasing if you are happy with the current atlasing, have baked more sets of lightmaps for your scene and want to make sure, that after adding one more object to the scene the atlasing won't change making the scene incompatible with other lightmap sets.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>Remember that Lock Atlas locks only atlasing, not the mesh UVs. If you change your source mesh and the mesh importer is set to generate lightmap UVs, the UVs might be generated differently and your current lightmap will look incorrectly on the object - to fix this you will need to re-bake the lightmap.
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><h3>Custom Beast bake settings</h3>
<p>If you need even more control over the bake process, see the <a href="../Manual/LightmappingCustomSettings.html">custom Beast settings</a> page.
