    <div class='vspace'></div><h1>Audio Listener</h1>
<p>The <span class='doc-keyword'>Audio Listener</span> acts as a microphone-like device. It receives input from any given <a href="../Components/class-AudioSource.html">Audio Source</a> in the scene and plays sounds through the computer speakers. For most applications it makes the most sense to attach the listener to the Main <a href="../Components/class-Camera.html">Camera</a>. If an audio listener is within the boundaries of a <a href="../Components/class-AudioReverbZone.html">Reverb Zone</a> reverberation is applied to all audible sounds in the scene. (PRO only) Furthermore, <a href="../Components/class-AudioEffect.html">Audio Effects</a> can be applied to the listener and it will be applied to all audible sounds in the scene.   
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><div><img class='figure' src='../Images/manual/Sound-0.jpg' /><br /><em>The Audio Listener, attached to the Main Camera</em></div>
<div class='vspace'></div><h2>Properties</h2>
<p>The Audio Listener has no properties.  It simply must be added to work.  It is always added to the Main Camera by default.
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><h2>Details</h2>
<p>The Audio Listener works in conjunction with <a href="../Components/class-AudioSource.html">Audio Sources</a>, allowing you to create the aural experience for your games.  When the Audio Listener is attached to a <span class='doc-keyword'>GameObject</span> in your scene, any Sources that are close enough to the Listener will be picked up and output to the computer's speakers.  Each scene can only have 1 Audio Listener to work properly.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>If the Sources are 3D (see import settings in <a href="../Components/class-AudioClip.html">Audio Clip</a>), the Listener will emulate position, velocity and orientation of the sound in the 3D world (You can tweak attenuation and 3D/2D behavior in great detail in <a href="../Components/class-AudioSource.html">Audio Source</a>) .  2D will ignore any 3D processing. For example, if your character walks off a street into a night club, the night club's music should probably be 2D, while the individual voices of characters in the club should be mono with their realistic positioning being handled by Unity.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>You should attach the Audio Listener to either the Main Camera or to the GameObject that represents the player. Try both to find what suits your game best.
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><h2>Hints</h2>
<ul><li>Each scene can only have one Audio Listener.
</li><li>You access the project-wide audio settings using the <a href="../Components/class-AudioManager.html">Audio Manager</a>, found in the <span class='doc-menu'>Edit-&gt;Project Settings-&gt;Audio</span> menu.
</li><li>View the <a href="../Components/class-AudioClip.html">Audio Clip</a> Component page for more information about Mono vs Stereo sounds.
</li></ul><h1>Audio Source</h1>
<p>The <span class='doc-keyword'>Audio Source</span> plays back an <a href="../Components/class-AudioClip.html">Audio Clip</a> in the scene. If the Audio Clip is a 3D clip, the source is played back at a given position and will attenuate over distance. The audio can be spread out between speakers (stereo to 7.1) (<em>Spread</em>) and morphed between 3D and 2D (<em>PanLevel</em>). This can be controlled over distance with falloff curves. Also, if the <a href="../Components/class-AudioListener.html">listener</a> is within one or multiple <a href="../Components/class-AudioReverbZone.html">Reverb Zones</a>, reverberations is applied to the source. (PRO only) Individual filters can be applied to each audio source for an even richer audio experience. See <a href="../Components/class-AudioEffect.html">Audio Effects</a> for more details.

</p><h2>Types of Rolloff</h2>
<p>There are three Rolloff modes: Logarithmic, Linear and Custom Rolloff. The Custom Rolloff can be modified by modifying the volume distance curve as described below. If you try to modify the volume distance function when it is set to Logarithmic or Linear, the type will automatically change to Custom Rolloff.
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><div><img class='figure' src='../Images/manual/Sound-2.jpg' /><br /><em>Rolloff Modes that an audio source can have.</em></div>
<div class='vspace'></div><h2>Distance Functions</h2>
<p>There are several properties of the audio that can be modified as a function of the distance between the audio source and the audio listener.
</p>
<p class='vspace'><span  style='color: red;'><span class='doc-keyword'>Volume</span></span>: Amplitude(0.0 - 1.0) over distance.<br /><span  style='color: green;'><span class='doc-keyword'>Pan</span></span>: Left(-1.0) to Right(1.0) over distance.<br /><span  style='color: blue;'><span class='doc-keyword'>Spread</span></span>: Angle (degrees 0.0 - 360.0) over distance.<br /><span  style='color: #B838CF;'><span class='doc-keyword'>Low-Pass</span></span> (only if LowPassFilter is attached to the AudioSource): Cutoff Frequency (22000.0-10.0) over distance.
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><div><img class='figure' src='../Images/manual/Sound-3.jpg' /><br /><em>Distance functions for Volume, Pan, Spread and Low-Pass audio filter. The current distance to the Audio Listener is marked in the graph.</em></div>
<p class='vspace'>To modify the distance functions, you can edit the curves directly. For more information, see the guide to <a href="../Components/EditingCurves.html">Editing Curves</a>.
</p>
<div class='vspace'></div><h2>Creating Audio Sources</h2>
<p>Audio Sources don't do anything without an assigned <span class='doc-prop'>Audio Clip</span>.  The Clip is the actual sound file that will be played back.  The Source is like a controller for starting and stopping playback of that clip, and modifying other audio properties.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>To create a new Audio Source:
</p><ol><li>Import your audio files into your Unity Project.  These are now Audio Clips.
</li><li>Go to <span class='doc-menu'>GameObject-&gt;Create Empty</span> from the menubar.
</li><li>With the new GameObject selected, select <span class='doc-menu'>Component-&gt;Audio-&gt;Audio Source</span>.
</li><li>Assign the <span class='doc-prop'>Audio Clip</span> property of the Audio Source Component in the Inspector.
</li></ol><p class='vspace'><b>Note:</b> If you want to create an <span class='doc-prop'>Audio Source</span> just for one <span class='doc-prop'>Audio Clip</span> that you have in the Assets folder then you can just drag that clip to the scene view - a GameObject with an <span class='doc-prop'>Audio Source</span> component will be created automatically for it. Dragging a clip onto on existing GameObject will attach the clip along with a new <span class='doc-prop'>Audio Source</span> if there isn't one already there. If the object does already have an <span class='doc-prop'>Audio Source</span> then the newly dragged clip will replace the one that the source currently uses.

<p>On mobile platforms compressed audio is encoded as MP3 for speedier decompression. Beware that this compression can remove samples at the end of the clip and potentially break a "perfect-looping" clip. Make sure the clip is right on a specific MP3 sample boundary to avoid sample clipping - tools to perform this task are widely available.
</p></div>
<h1>Audio Clip</h1>
<p><span class='doc-keyword'>Audio Clips</span> contain the audio data used by <a href="../Components/class-AudioSource.html">Audio Sources</a>.  Unity supports mono, stereo and multichannel audio assets (up to eight channels). The audio file formats that Unity can import are <b>.aif</b>, <b>.wav</b>, <b>.mp3</b>, and <b>.ogg</b>. Unity can also import <a href="../Manual/TrackerModules.html">tracker modules</a> in the <b>.xm</b>, <b>.mod</b>, <b>.it</b>, and <b>.s3m</b> formats. The tracker module assets behave the same way as any other audio assets in Unity although no waveform preview is available in the asset import inspector.

</table>
<div class='vspace'></div><h2>Importing Audio Assets</h2>
<p>Unity supports both <em>Compressed</em> and <em>Native</em> Audio.  Any type of file (except MP3/Ogg Vorbis) will be initially imported as <em>Native</em>. Compressed audio files must be decompressed by the CPU while the game is running, but have smaller file size. If <em>Stream</em> is checked the audio is decompressed <em>on the fly</em>, otherwise it is decompressed completely as soon as it loads. Native PCM formats (WAV, AIFF) have the benefit of giving higher fidelity without increasing the CPU overhead, but files in these formats are typically much larger than compressed files. Module files (.mod,.it,.s3m..xm) can deliver very high quality with an extremely low footprint.
</p>
<p class='vspace'>As a general rule of thumb, <em>Compressed</em> audio (or modules) are best for long files like background music or dialog, while <em>Native</em> is better for short sound effects. You should tweak the amount of Compression using the compression slider. Start with high compression and gradually reduce the setting to the point where the loss of sound quality is perceptible. Then, increase it again slightly until the perceived loss of quality disappears.
</p>
<p class='vspace'><a name='PositionalAudio' id='PositionalAudio'></a>
</p><h2>Using 3D Audio</h2>
<p>If an audio clip is marked as a <span class='doc-prop'>3D Sound</span> then it will be played back so as to simulate its position in the game world's 3D space. 3D sounds emulate the distance and location of sounds by attenuating volume and panning across speakers. Both mono and multiple channel sounds can be positioned in 3D. For multiple channel audio, use the <em>spread</em> option on the <a href="../Components/class-AudioSource.html">Audio Source</a> to spread and split out the discrete channels in speaker space. Unity offers a variety of options to control and fine-tune the audio behavior in 3D space - see the <a href="../Components/class-AudioSource.html">Audio Source</a> component reference for further details.
